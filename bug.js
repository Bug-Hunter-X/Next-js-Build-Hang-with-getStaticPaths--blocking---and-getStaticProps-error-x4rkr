In Next.js, a subtle error can occur when using dynamic routes and `getStaticPaths`. If the `fallback` option in `getStaticPaths` is set to `'blocking'`, and the data fetching within `getStaticProps` throws an error for a specific path, the entire application might hang indefinitely during build time. This is because the `'blocking'` fallback waits for all paths to be generated successfully before proceeding, and a single failure can block the entire process.
